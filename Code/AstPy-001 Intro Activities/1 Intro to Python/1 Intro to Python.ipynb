    "These introductory notebooks are designed to give you basic Python skills and let you practice them. Python is used by Astronomers all over the world to run simulations, analyse telescope data, and much much more. The first two activities teach you the basics of Python 3, NumPy - a Python library for numerical calculations and arrays, Matplotlib - a plotting library, and Pandas - a library for manipulating csv's and other files. The rest of the intro activities get you to practice using the skills you have learnt and build on them further.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are stuck you can consult the Python and NumPy docs at https://docs.python.org/3/, and https://numpy.org/doc/stable/, find help from one of these websites www.w3schools.com, www.python.org, www.learnpython.org (great intro lessons here) or you can also get advice from www.stackoverflow.com.\n",
