Adapted from - Eleanor Lutz, Tabletop Whale, https://github.com/eleanorlutz/topography_atlas_of_space

Data on the thickness of layers in the planets.  
object - name of object  
color - hex colour (for plotting)  
layer_type- 'compositional' or 'mechanical' (NA for Gas Giants)  
atm - 'y' or 'n' is the layer an atmospheric layer  
name - name of layer  
color_simp and name_simp - simplified names and colours for multiplanet plotting (leads to less legend entries)  
depth_order - layer number with 0 for the core  
depth - height/depth of that layer (km)  
depth_from_core - the distance from the centre of the object to the top of the current layer (km)  
reference - reference for the data (Earth data not too sure on taken from hyperphysics mainly)  

Note Venus and the Gas Giants have no mechanical entries in the csv.
Colours are chosen so the plots look nice.
Earth radius is just aboe the actual radius if you google it but this is because the Earth isn't a perfect sphere and I used a value for continental crust in the csv not oceanic (which is ~10 km not 30 km).
