From A. Garcia Munoz et al - Upper Atmospheres and Ionospheres of Planets and Satellites [https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1712/1712.02994.pdf](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1712/1712.02994.pdf)

Contains data on the exobase (bottom layer of the exosphere) for the planets and Titan.

***object*** - name of the object  
***exobase alt*** - altitude in the atmosphere of the exobase (km)  
***exobase alt range*** - if the value in the paper was given as a range ***exobase alt*** is the center value and this column contains the range either side of possible values (similar to a +- error but I hesitate to call it that) in km  
***exobase temp high*** - max temp of the exobase in K (daytime)  
***exobase temp low*** - min temp of the exobase in K (nightime) - sometimes this is the same as the high value  
***esc vel*** - the escape velocity of the planet in km/s

Note the temperatures for Mercury are average surface temperatures since it has no appreciable atmosphere.
